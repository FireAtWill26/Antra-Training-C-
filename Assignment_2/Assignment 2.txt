1. When we want to have a string that won't be changed later, we want to use string. If we want to have a string that will be modified a lot, we want to use StringBuilder.

2. The base class for all arrays is System.Array.

3. We can use Array.sort(ourArray) to sort arrays.

4. We can use Length property to get the total number of elements in an array.

5. No, the type of data is set when we declare the array.

6. Array.Copyto() is used to copy the elements of all array to a target array that is already defined, which means that the target array must have the same type and length
   as the source array. Array.Clone() creates a new array that contain same elements as the source array.
